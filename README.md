#Cooking Roll Playing Game

#Project Description
RPG where you as a player steps into a master kitchen as a chef. There you will fight not only great master chefs like Massimo Bottura and Anthony Bourdain but also
angry guests whom are not too satisfied. 

The challenge was to create an RPG where the player will fight enemies and throughout the game earn both gold and gain experience as well as loose fights and thereby 
also health and lives. During the game the player will also be requested to buy defence items which he'll be able to use prior to being attacked by the enemy. 
In the main menu also can choose to view his current player stats and if done for now - exit the game.
